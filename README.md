# naive-bayes
I have coded Naive Bayes classifier for multi class data from scratch without using sckitlearn.
I have only used numpy and pandas.
The "naive" assumption of Naive Bayes (that the features are conditionally independent) is critical to making these calculations simple.
The normalization constant (the denominator) can be ignored since it's the same for all classes.
The prior probability is much less relevant once you have a lot of features.
