# naive-bayes
The code is pretty straight forward and well documented. The preprocessing of the documents and the implementation of classifiers have been done from scratch. The code has been arranged in form of jypter Notebooks.I have coded Naive Bayes classifier for multi class data from scratch without using sckitlearn.
I have only used numpy and pandas.
The "naive" assumption of Naive Bayes (that the features are conditionally independent) is critical to making these calculations simple.
The normalization constant (the denominator) can be ignored since it's the same for all classes.
The prior probability is much less relevant once you have a lot of features.
